TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.747 ns between v1/hcounter_reg[7]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and S1/circle_on_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0).

Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
