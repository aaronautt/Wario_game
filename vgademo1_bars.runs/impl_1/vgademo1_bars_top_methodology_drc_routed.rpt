2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at S1/d0 of size 15x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at S1/d0__0 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at S1/d0__1 of size 18x15, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at S1/d0__2 of size 15x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#5 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at S1/d0__3 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#6 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at S1/d0__4 of size 18x15, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.595 ns between S1/y_pos_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and S1/Green_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.921 ns between S1/y_pos_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and S1/Red_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.984 ns between S1/y_pos_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and S1/Blue_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
